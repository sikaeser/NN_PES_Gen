Readme on how to optimize a structure and calculate harmonic frequencies using ASE.

1) In both python scripts make sure the parameters (including path to your best model, hyperparameters, etc...) are exactly as used for training
2) Create an .xyz file containing the molecule/structure you want to predict
3) Optimize it using ASE (./optimize.py -i structure.xyz --fmax 0.00001)
4) Visualize the optimized structure to make sure everything is as expected
5) Calculate harmonic frequencies using ASE (./ase_vibrations.py -i opt_structure.xyz)
